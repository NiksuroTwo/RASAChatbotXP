A QA system receives an input in the form of sentences and produces the predictive sentences that are responses to the input. Therefore, a model that can learn such conversations is needed. This research focuses on developing a chatbot based on a sequence-to-sequence model. It is trained using a data set of conversation from a university admission. Evaluation on a small dataset obtained from the Telkom University admission on Whatsapp instant messaging application shows that the model produces a quite high BLEU score of 41.04. An attention mechanism technique using the reversed sentences improves the model to gives a higher BLEU up to 44.68.},

There has been a recent upsurge in speech based search engines and assistants such as Siri, Google Chrome and Cortana. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as NLTK for Python can be applied to analyse speech, and intelligent responses can be found by designing an engine to provide appropriate human like responses. This type of programme is called a Chatbot, which is the focus of this study. This paper presents a survey on the techniques used to design Chatbots and a comparison is made between different design techniques from nine carefully selected papers according to the main methods adopted. These papers are representative of the significant improvements in Chatbots in the last decade. The paper discusses the similarities and differences in the techniques and examines in particular the Loebner prize-winning Chatbots.},

	abstract = {The gastronomic sector is one of the most welcomed and most important in generating income nationally, Machala specifically is one of the cities that has obtained greater benefits due to its capital city situation. The attempts of gastronomic companies to seek productive excellence have been extensive, consequently, have developed various commercial strategies that allow restaurants to approach the customer and interact with him, digital content, commonly integrated into websites is one of them. A well-developed digital medium through factors such as: styling, presentation, decoration, etc. can generate a pleasant visual impact on the customer and therefore their attraction. It is notorious that the client is the main point of attention and it is who must work, however, there are still spaces to complete, and are precisely those that are directly linked to the comfort and satisfaction of the consumer, among the situations to consider the problem based on the lack of a complete online gastronomic service stands out, because so far the methods of searching for restaurants, placing orders and other services are carried out independently, ie there is no environment that brings together or groups the services of the main restaurants of Machala in a single platform. Therefore, the present technological proposal entitled Implementation of an e-commerce service through the XP methodology focused on the gastronomy of Machala, which is aimed at those users of the gastronomic sector of this city. The objective of this proposal is to facilitate the search for restaurants, automate the ordering process and other services in a single environment. The implementation of this virtual platform for restaurants in the city of Machala, located in the province of El Oro, Ecuador, is based on a predominant trend in the current world, called Digital Marketing, a trend that allows sharing commercial content to reach proximity and trust with the customer. Within this area has been selected the E-commerce model or also known as online stores that consists of buying and selling, marketing and all kinds of commercial process type online, this trend has been widely welcomed by the business sector and represents the future for many businesses. As for the organization of the project, was used the agile methodology called XP (Extreme Programming) which is based on continuous communication of the team and is ideal for projects with changing processes. The platform is divided into two parts: The first is the Administrative part which consists of managing all types of information (Users, dishes, blogs, etc.) and the second is the public part, used for direct interaction with the consumer. As a development framework, Django was used over Python and Ajax; for the storage of the information the PostgreSQL database manager was considered, finally, Apache was used as the server of the public part of the application and Centos 7 as the server of the administrative part.},

Specifically, social chatbots are the ones which establish a strong emotional relationship with the user. The main concept behind this chatbot was to provide mental relief to students who undergo different levels of stress and which can be the onset of an inimical depression. In this paper, we proposed an intelligent social therapeutic chatbot which distributes the text into emotion labels namely, Happy, Joy, Shame, Anger, Disgust, Sadness, Guilt, and Fear. Further, based on the emotion label, it identify the users' mental state such as stressed or depressed using users' chat data. For emotion detection, we deployed three popular deep learning classifiers namely, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (CNN), and Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN). In particular, the proposed methodology of the chatbot is domain specific where through the users' interaction, the chatbot will try to prevent the pessimistic actions and rebuild more constructive thoughts.},
